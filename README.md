### <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Hello, I'm Kevin Göhler!

I work as a Backend Developer for SHD Einzelhandelssoftware. I'm located near Koblenz, Germany.

In 2017, I started an apprenticeship in software development. In this apprenticeship I focused on web development with a focus on E-Commerce with Shopware 6.

I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects, helping to make this world a little better through design & code. ✨😍

### What I'm focusing on 👨‍💻

Currently improving my skills: Symfony and VueJS for Shopware development.<br />
